# ヤッホー !

You may call me **Kohi**! (*she/her, they/them*)
Currently, I am assisting with programming Salvus Aries for [Rosemilk Studio](https://twitter.com/rosemilkstudio).  
I've been programming since 2019 and enjoy the process in turning imaginations into ✨ magic ✨ by making them come true.

My current weapons of choice are **Unity**, **RenPy**, and **Unreal**. I can speak Python and C# to make your game come to life. 
I can also conjure HTML5/CSS3 with JavaScript or any JavaScript based framework to make your websites go online in this digital space.
